Costs
Most of the costs associated with Information Security Management system would be incurred
anyway since information security is a business and compliance imperative. The additional costs
specifically related to the ISMS are;
•
Resources needed to design, implement and operate the ISMS, including project
management for the implementation project.
• Expensive, requires specific IT budget.
• Special expertise are required, who has knowledge in this area.
• Time required applying them to company users.
• Resources required providing ongoing training and awareness.
• Have to increase Servers and data storage facilities.
• Access issues, delay for system.
• Poor active participation of employees.
• Changes needed to bring various business processes and activities in line with the ISO
standards.
•
Third party compliance audits (optional – only required if we decide to go for
certification, a decision that can be made once the ISMS is working).
